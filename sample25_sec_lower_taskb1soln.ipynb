  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q1: Everyday AI — Convenience vs Privacy\n","- (a) Benefit: quicker awareness of entries/exits; potential safety alerts. Risk: continuous camera snapshots expose household routines; data misuse if shared.\n","- (b) Safer setting: retain snapshots for 24–48 hours with opt‑in notifications only for unfamiliar activity. Trade‑off: reduced history but improved privacy and lower exposure."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q2: Human Responsibility\n","- (a) Humans must judge health/safety; chatbots lack context and ethics.\n","- (b) Add human approval: flagged health‑related suggestions require teacher/parent confirmation before shown; include a ‘report unsafe advice’ control."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q3: Media Influence\n","- (a) Negative effect: students may over‑trust sensational claims, shaping biased views on AI capabilities or risks.\n","- (b) Design change: add credibility indicators (source labels, expert review) and reduce amplification of low‑quality content via ranking penalties."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q4: Dataset Bias\n","- (a) Failure case: poorer recognition for under‑represented groups (higher false negatives); unfair outcomes.\n","- (b) Safeguards: collect more diverse samples; periodic fairness audits (per‑group accuracy/false rates); include review gates before deployment."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q5: ML Pipeline Basics\n","- (a) Steps: collect labelled readings → split into train/test → train a simple classifier → evaluate on test with chosen metric.\n","- (b) Metric: recall (for ‘noisy’) if missing noisy periods is costlier (classroom management); accuracy only if classes balanced and risks symmetric."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q6: Symbolic vs Statistical\n","- (a) Choose symbolic rules (e.g., sort by class level, then valid ticket). Deterministic, transparent, fits discrete conditions.\n","- (b) Failure case: invalid/missing ticket flag; address by validation rules and clear exception handling (manual review queue)."]},
  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Q7: System Design\n","- (a) Problem: improve recycling bin usage in school; beneficiaries: students, facilities team.\n","- (b) Datasets & metric: bin weight/volume readings and timestamps; metric: daily correctly sorted items % or contamination rate.\n","- (c) Edge case: sensor drift or jam; iterate with periodic calibration checks and anomaly alerts; add manual spot audits."]}
